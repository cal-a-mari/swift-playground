/*
 Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
 
 Input: arr[] = {1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2};
 Output: 4
 The subsequence 1, 3, 4, 2 is the longest subsequence
 of consecutive elements
 
 Input: arr[] = {36, 41, 56, 35, 44, 33, 34, 92, 43, 32, 42}
 Output: 5
 The subsequence 36, 35, 33, 34, 32 is the longest subsequence
 of consecutive elements.
